"""Extraction for the knowledge graph: Parquet rows in, node and edge records out.

Deliberately free of Neo4j calls. The counts this module produces are predicted in
docs/challenge-3/spec_challenge3.md, so a failure here surfaces against a test rather

Two grains matter, and mixing them was the mistake the Phase 0 audit caught:

  * Flight, Weather and Aircraft come from the **loaded day(s)**. They are instances.
  * Service and the Airport/Airline statistics come from the **whole year**. They are
    aggregates, and at day grain a Service has roughly one flight, which tells you
